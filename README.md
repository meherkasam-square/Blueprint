## Declarative UI construction for iOS, written in Swift

Blueprint greatly simplifies the task of building and updating views as application state changes.

```swift
let view = BlueprintView(element: Label(text: "Hello from Blueprint!"))
```

### What does this library do?

Blueprint provides an architecture that allows you to:
- Declaratively define a UI hierarchy as pure values (Swift structs and enums).
- Display that hierarchy within your application.
- Update that hierarchy as application state changes (including animated transitions).

### When should I use it?

Use Blueprint any time you want to display a view hierarchy, but don't want to manage view lifecycle (hint: managing view lifecycle is a large portion of most conventional UIKit code). There are times when you *want* to manage view lifecycle (complex animations and transitions are a good example), and for these cases you may want to stick with a conventional approach.

### How does it interact with UIKit?

Blueprint is not a replacement for UIKit! From the beginning, Blueprint has been designed as a compliment to all of the powerful tools that come with the platform. You can use Blueprint to manage the display of a single view controller, or of a single view representing a small part of the screen. Likewise, it's straightforward to host standard views and controls *within* a blueprint hierarchy, always leaving you with an escape hatch.

### How does it interact with SwiftUI?

They serve similar purposes, and SwiftUI has heavily influenced Blueprint's API. However, Blueprint predates SwiftUI, and works a bit differently. You can host a `BlueprintView` in SwiftUI to embed Blueprint within SwiftUI, and you can also use the provided `ElementView` to create Xcode previews of Blueprint. Because SwiftUI is hosted by a UIViewController, and Blueprint is hosted in a UIView, we don't provide a way to embed SwiftUI within Blueprint.

## Getting Started

### Swift Package Manager

[![SwiftPM compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/SwiftPM-compatible-orange.svg)](#swift-package-manager)

If you are developing your own package, be sure that Blueprint is included in `dependencies`
in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/square/Blueprint", from: "5.1.0")
]
```

In Xcode 11+, add Blueprint directly as a dependency to your project with
`File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency...`. Provide the git URL when prompted: `git@github.com:square/Blueprint.git`.

Two modules are provided:
- `BlueprintUI` contains the core architecture and layout types.
- `BlueprintUICommonControls` includes elements representing some common `UIKit` views and controls.

## Local Development

This project uses [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and [Tuist](https://tuist.io/) to generate a project for local development. Follow the steps below for the recommended setup for zsh.

```sh
# install mise
brew install mise
# add mise activation line to your zshrc
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
# load mise into your shell
source ~/.zshrc
# tell mise to trust Blueprint's config file
mise trust
# install dependencies
mise install

# only necessary for first setup or after changing dependencies
tuist install --path SampleApp
# generates and opens the Xcode project
tuist generate --path SampleApp
```
